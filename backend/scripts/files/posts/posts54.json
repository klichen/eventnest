It occurs when hydrogen atoms diffuse into a metal\u2019s microstructure, resulting in cracks and reducing the material\u2019s load-bearing capacity. This phenomenon is exacerbated by environmental factors like temperature, pressure, and corrosive agents, as well as manufacturing defects. While advanced alloys and protective measures have been developed to mitigate HE, the examination of its effects requires time and resources for the preparation and tensile testing of alloys. Although cathodic charging methods have been utilized to accelerate HE in samples, there is much room for failure, further extending experiment time. Therefore, theoretical models, such as those based on Fick\u2019s laws of diffusion, play a crucial role in predicting HE under different conditions, offering a more efficient approach to study hydrogen diffusion, trapping, and embrittlement. This talk explores the mechanisms of HE, including hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity and hydrogen-induced decohesion, and proposes a phenomenological model that simulates hydrogen diffusion and trapping. This model produces a highly accurate model of hydrogen transport and diffusion in a metal based on initial conditions confirmed by experimental evidence."
