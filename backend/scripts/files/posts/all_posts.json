Studying how comets move around the Sun is one of the oldest problems in theoretical astrophysics. In this AstroTours, we will explore what comets are made of, how they move, and how you can spot them! Then, we will explore what will happen to comets billions of years from now, when the Sun will have exhausted its nuclear fuel and become a white dwarf \u2014 a dead star. \n\nImage Credit: https://news.mit.edu/2017/scientists-detect-comets-outside-our-solar-system-1026"

Official (OCG) and Trading Card Game (TCG) tournament that is set to be held in Seattle from 7-8 September 2024, being the most prestigious and final event of the 2023-2024 season.\nIt will be held alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links World Championship 2024 as well as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel World Championship 2024[1]. For the first time ever, the Duel Links World Championship will be split into two separate categories, namely Speed Duel (the traditional format in Duel Links) and Rush Duel (which was added to the game in September 2023). However, the total amount of players for the Duel Links category will stay the same as the Speed Duel tournament has been reduced from 24 to 16 players, and the newly added Rush Duel Championship will only have 8 competitors.\nMeanwhile, the Master Duel category has been increased from 8 to 12 teams, now also including players who qualified by making first place at a Duelist Cup or collecting Season Points.\n\nThis tournament will mark the first World Championship in North America since 2016. It's also going to be the latest World Championship ever, as the tournament had almost exclusively taken place in early to mid August before.\n\nAs of mid August 2024, all competitors across all categories are known.\n\nCredits:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iRj0zcUiNw\n\n#yugioh #meme #uoft #uoftcgc #funny #pokemon #cardgames #ifyoudanceilldance #pookie #short #shortfilm #pokemongo #pokemon"

Pok\u00e9mon TCG, VGC, and Pok\u00e9mon GO players must hit a threshold of Championship Points to earn their Worlds invitation, whereas Pok\u00e9mon UNITE teams must finish near the top of the Championship Point rankings in their rating zone. The number of Championship Points required to receive an invitation is based on both geographical rating zone and age division.\n\nThe very best players will receive an award for travel to attend the event.\n\nPlayers in Japan, South Korea, and the Asia-Pacific region will be awarded World Championships invitations as per their regions\u2019 organized play and esports programs.

It was established pursuant to the multilateral treaties Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of 1891 and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (1989), which has been the sole governing treaty since 2016.[2]\n\nThe Madrid System provides a centrally administered system for obtaining multiple trademark registrations in separate jurisdictions; it does not create a single unified registration across different jurisdictions, as in the case of the European Union trademark system.[3] Rather, applicants file a single international trademark application and pay one set of fees to apply for protection in any or all countries that are members of the system; each country has discretion to grant the application. Once the trademark authority of a designated country grants protection, the mark is protected in that jurisdiction just as if that office had registered it.[1]\n\nThe Madrid System is administered by the International Bureau of the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland. As of February 2023, the Madrid System consists of 114 members covering 130 countries;[4] known collectively as the Madrid Union, they represent more than 80% of world trade.[4]\n\n#uoft #tradingcards"
