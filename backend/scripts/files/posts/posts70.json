There will be two computers hosting 3 games each over the span of 2 hours (each game hosts around 6 people). NO SIGN UP NEEDED, FIRST COME FIRST SERVE\n\nWe will also have board games on the side while you are waiting for your turn in Jackbox, so if you just want to play some board games or just chill, you can come and treat this as a normal board game night. (the room is still booked from 6pm - 10pm)\n\nHope to see you all there!"
