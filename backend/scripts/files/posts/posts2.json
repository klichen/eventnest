Our September AstroTour features PhD Candidate Dang Pham's talk on comets at 8:00PM, followed by exciting astronomy demos and telescope tours at 9:00PM!\n\nTalk abstract : Comets at night and the Sun during the day have always mesmerised humanity. Studying how comets move around the Sun is one of the oldest problems in theoretical astrophysics. In this AstroTours, we will explore what comets are made of, how they move, and how you can spot them! Then, we will explore what will happen to comets billions of years from now, when the Sun will have exhausted its nuclear fuel and become a white dwarf \u2014 a dead star. \n\nImage Credit: https://news.mit.edu/2017/scientists-detect-comets-outside-our-solar-system-1026"
