Throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, the station maintained its commitment to pursuing the issues and stories ignored by most mainstream news outlets. By doing so Input Radio and its successor CJUT developed a loyal audience in Toronto. The next obvious step was to increase the station’s broadcast range by becoming an FM station. This was accomplished in 1986, and CJUT became CIUT-FM. While continuing to reach both University of Toronto students and the broader Toronto community, the station also found new audiences all across Central and Southern Ontario.
