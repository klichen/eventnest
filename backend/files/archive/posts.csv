Why did you join 180dc? 
I initially joined 180DC because it seemed like a place where I could combine my interests in consulting with my desire to learn more about management. Over the past year, I’ve realized that 180 has the potential to be a proponent of real change and personal development. Our work with clients and the focus on learning and applying concepts we’ve learned in school truly is a unique opportunity to fill in the gaps of traditional education. What’s better, I feel that there is purpose and fulfilment in the work we do, and I’ve made some great friends while I’m at it!

First up is Antonia Rubinia, our beloved co-president of 180dc. 
Why did you join 180dc?
Business School wasn’t cutting it when it came to learning how to lead a team, application from theory to real world, and consulting experience. I decided to take my development into my own hands and it landed me at a student organization that transforms not only non-profits but dedicated students as well.

“As we mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of World War II (WWII), some participated who are barely acknowledged. Including the contributions of the two and a half million Indians who volunteered to take up arms for their British colonial rulers. This erasure is especially astonishing because WWII was truly global, with pivotal conflicts outside the European and Pacific theaters and critical battles in British India and across Asia. 

The story of these soldiers has left South Asia with a complex and incomplete narrative of what happened as we gained independence from British colonial rule. These volunteers fought in the mountains of Burma, the hills of Italy, and the deserts of North Africa. They transported artillery, repaired jeeps, cooked, and, under enemy fire, carried the wounded from the battlefield to safety. Thirty of them won Victoria Crosses, England’s highest military honor, and more than eighty-seven thousand died.

These family photographs and stories come from all quadrants of South Asia. Some are from middle-class families, from royalty, and others from low-income families. Some of these soldiers were swashbuckling young men who believed in “the cause.” Others joined out of poverty in search of a regular meal and salary, their hunger exacerbated by the famine (created by the British) that started in Bengal and spread to other parts of India.

These are some of their stories”^

Unniversity of Toronto Cupid's Arrow (UTCA) hosted a successful Charity Cupcake Sale for Ovarian Cancer Canada, bringing the community together to raise awareness and funds for this important cause. 

Students, faculty, and members of the surrounding community gathered to sample and purchase an array of delicious cupcakes；made by local bakers and decorated with the signature teal color of Ovarian Cancer Canada. Throughout the event, attendees had the opportunity to learn about the organization's mission and ways to get involved in their efforts to support those affected by ovarian cancer. 

UTCA did a fantastic job of organizing the event and creating a fun and festive atmosphere that encouraged attendees to get involved and support the cause. 

With the support of the community, the event was able to raise a substantial amount of money for Ovarian Cancer Canada, which will help further their important work. 

The Charity Cupcake Sale was a sweet and meaningful way to bring attention to this important cause and support those affected by ovarian cancer.^
