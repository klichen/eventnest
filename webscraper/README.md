how to use the scraper

individual scraper code is stored under "spiders"

go to "uoftscrape" to see the code for the uoft scraper

i am using command line right now to run stuff:
install the dependencies
navigate to top directory (\webscraper)
to run the scraper and get an output file do --> scrapy crawl uoftscrape -o links.json
do -O to replace the file, -o to append to the file
